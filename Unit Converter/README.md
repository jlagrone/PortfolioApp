# PortfolioApp
I created Unit Converter to demonstrate my use of 
* Swift
* Core Data
* SwiftUI
    * SceneStorage for state restoration
    * UserDefaults to store User Preferences
    
The app tries to leverage Apple's Measurement API for doing conversions between common units in the Metric and Imperial systems.
